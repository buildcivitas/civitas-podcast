## How my podcast system works

This is my fourth podcast:

1. [Unicorn Meta Zoo](https://unicorn-meta-zoo.github.io/)
2. [Admitted](https://talk.collegeconfidential.com/t/admitted-the-official-college-confidential-podcast/3638125)
3. [Psalm a Day](https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/jericson)
4. [Building Civitas](https://buildcivitas.com/civitas-podcast/)

Each of these podcasts was produced using different methods and I'm bringing together my favorite bits to make this podcast.

### Recording

The key question is if you have remote guests or not. While you can get better results with software designed for remote recording, such as [Zencastr](https://zencastr.com/), I've had good luck just getting on a call with people using video meeting software (Zoom, Microsoft Teams, Google Meet, etc.) and recording the call. Most people already know one or more of these systems and it's a lot quicker to get to the recording stage.

 Generally speaking, it helps if everyone is on headphones to avoid sound from other speakers leaking in, but modern computers do a good job of avoiding that problem. Good mics can get better sound, but even the built-in mics work for most conversations.

When it's just me reading from a screen, I find [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/) gives me flexibility to set up the screen the way I want it. That said, I've had some luck recording myself in my own Zoom room. 

### Editing

My philosophy of podcast productions is "Do as little as possible." By all means hire an editor to get the most out of your recording _after you've proven your success_. Interesting content will help you build an audience as long as you've got a minimal level of quality.

If the podcast is going on YouTube, [YouTube Studio](https://studio.youtube.com/) works well to edit out awkward pauses and that sort of thing. 

I use my [edit_podcast.rb](https://github.com/jericson/edit_podcast.rb) script to mix the audio. It removes noise and sets the audio levels to a reasonable place.
